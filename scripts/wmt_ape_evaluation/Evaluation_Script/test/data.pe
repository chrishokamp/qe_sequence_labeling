In public , all members of the contact group attempted to leave the question of Kosovo 's final status open , but in private the United States and some of its allies told the two parties they propose the independence this year .
Some members of the Security Council , notably Russia and China , take a dim view of or remain sceptical about an imposed solution , and few governments are in favor of dividing up the territory of another nation , however compelling the circumstances may be .
Being given the political instability of Serbia , they put in doubt the damage that would cause a delay in the short term , which would be mainly self-inflicted .
But delaying the decision would only allow Kostunica to find new ways to make even more difficult a decision by the Security Council .
For the first time in the modern history of Korea , the presidential campaign has truly been the site of debates on the central issues which the country must face , rather than focusing on the parties and personalities .
The candidate Roh has called for new relations between South Korea and America , based on the principle of independence and equality .
Knowing these targets would be a difficult test even for the most experienced and the most cynical politician , then knowing if President Roh can succeed would be a good omen .
Any failure , however , connotes so horrific outlook that nobody can really wish him that .
Initially , this retreat leaves many governments sceptical , but they have come to realize , as they say in Washington , that this was the only thing to do .
Among them , as among the Palestinians , some hope that after the withdrawal from Gaza , it will be possible to return to the road map and resume negotiations that will lead to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians .
BERLIN : Like old horses becoming frisky again at the sound of the bugle , the strategists of the Cold War feel their adrenalin rate increasing when missile defense is once again in the headlines .
To be sure , the anti-missile defense proposed by Bill Clinton ( reluctantly ) and George W. Bush ( enthusiastically ) -- and solidly backed by the American Congress -- does not resemble the Star Wars dream of Ronald Reagan 20 years ago : the NMD ( nuclear missile defense ) , an American anti-missile defense system , is only supposed to catch a modest number of warheads and thus does not furnish complete protection against enemy missiles .
The political consequences are further reinforced by the fact that , thirty years ago , the United States and the Soviet Union gave up on establishing an effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles .
Normally , an American defense project still in an embryonic state , should not cause as much excitement as the NMD .
The previous " nyet " from Russia might not turn out to be final .
Thus the political turmoil which Russia and Europe are involved in will perhaps calm down .
Developing countries have already invested a lot as far as younger people are concerned .
They are now better educated and healthier than previous generations .
Many countries are now trying to facilitate access to secondary ( " high school " ) education , particularly through " conditional aid programs " that allow for the distribution of funds to poor families whose children attend school regularly .
These programs have helped increase the number of pupils in secondary school in Mexico , Ecuador , Bangladesh and Cambodia .
In fact , the paternalistic attitude of EU institutions to the country homebuyers threatens to create a two-tier Europe which will complicate the process of integration .
The conceding countries have held their market share by achieving trade integration with EU countries that are more advanced than other countries .
Ironically , the candidate nations find themselves being lectured to by officials of the ECB and the Commission on the compromise between nominal convergence and real convergence .
It would appear that Brussels ' only imperative is the targeted growth of candidate countries , and that macroeconomic stability can wait .
In any case , it was too late to protest since the ten eastern countries had actually become full European Union members .
But now , the 25 states must face the economic consequences of this growth , not only on the issue of the size of the entire European budget for the next seven years , but also on the distribution of donor and recipient countries .
It took time for the British to understand that since President Jacques Chirac was a shaky and desperate president , remaining in the Élysée until 2007 but possessing no power , he did not have the means to make such a bargain .
Once the British became aware of this harsh reality , they played their pitiful last card in the handling of the negotiations . They made ridiculously paltry offers , all primarily designed to safeguard Britain 's petty interests and did so mainly at the expense of the new member states .
Over the past 25 years , European unemployment has increased as the monetary policy does , and interest rates were raised to combat inflation .
But while inflation has yielded , unemployment has not fallen , or almost not .
It is another matter when the European project means that French workers will have to face competition from Polish plumbers , Roumanian farmers and Turkish vendors .
In Germany , voters seem poised to evict the Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder , because his lukewarm allegiance to the neo-liberal project displeases them .
Similarly , almost everyone understands that global warming could be whether more serious , or less serious than existing models suggest , but that this uncertainty is not an excuse to do nothing .
In fact , it should instead prompt us to better protect ourselves if we knew that global warming would occur exactly according to the average projections .
One expects the improvement of technologies and their dissemination to make the world much richer by 2100 : With an annual growth of 2 percent , it will reach almost 40,000 euros per head in terms of 2006 purchasing power .
These critics argue therefore we have much more need today of this € 55 marginal expense than people richer in 2100 will need the € 400 that they would earn by being preserved the effects of climate change .
This phenomenon only underlines the need to ensure the safety of medicines .
The fact that all drugs , in addition to their benefits , produce adverse effects in some patients is one reason why pharmacovigilance exists .
It is time to be serious .
· Citizens and governments must make pharmacovigilance a priority , and commit the resources needed to solve the problem .
However , after five years of military efforts , strategies based on the targeting of a single opponent have only worsened the situation .
It is time to understand the new model of conflict that is currently emerging .
At present , most of the price of a product finances the huge and inefficient organization which assembled it .
Almost all the creativity and problem solving occur in small businesses and are " integrated " later by big companies , those whose infrastructure is expensive and fragile , and that retain the bulk of profits .
This is why the actions of the Bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of online terrorist activity .
Bush 's rhetoric " them and us " clearly defines an " other " and positions it as a cohesive enemy .
Which is the true meaning of the word " solidarity " as the Petit Robert dictionary defines it : " relationship between people who are aware of a commonality of interest " .
Solidarity as meaning a unit resulting from common interests also clearly exists in the 15 original members that members of the enlarged Union today .
One should only look at the number of respectable citizens of Turkish origin living in Germany .
Or the large number of second generation British Indians and Pakistanis that we now see wearing a tie , laptop in hand , always between two aircraft .
Imagining the post-Kyoto world will offer us a chance to start a new dialogue and to consider new options for climate change .
The nations could establish a more ambitious goal which would be to limit long-term change in the Earth 's temperature , then allocate emissions rights among countries so as to ultimately restrict temperature increases to an acceptable level .
State of the art or art of the State ?
September is traditionally the month when orchestras and opera companies leave the festivals of Aix , Salzburg , Tanglewood and many others to return home .
If the public has progressive tastes , private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible .
The corollary is that public money makes possible an adventurous programming even if the public 's taste has a tendency to be conservative .
Respect for the law , Russian-style .
Throughout the world , we are concerned with the disappearances of political freedoms in Vladimir Putin 's Russia .
The new Chechen authorities appear to be delighted .
With respect to the Yukos affair , my office cannot intervene in any ongoing legal proceedings .
It is almost impossible without co-operation with non-governmental human rights organizations in Russia .
I also consider that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities .
The strategy made by the Pope for the Catholic Church and its ability to mobilize millions of believers to its cause have meant that no one can never repeat the question posed by Stalin : " How many divisions the Pope has ? "
John Paul II demonstrated that moral strength was a weapon powerful enough to undo the division of the world established at Yalta .
But it has also created men such as Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel , who have defended their supreme values by referring to a secular humanism and speaking in its name .
However , for most people , life under a totalitarian dictatorship was certainly nothing ennobling ; rather it acted as a daily immersion into lies , spiritual depravity and material corruption .
Experience is the right word here .
Indeed , Kosovo has turned into a tube test of the international intervention .
This leads me to another key point : a possible exit strategy is as important to the success of any humanitarian intervention in the future that the entry strategy .
For international intervention to have a real chance of success , it is advisable from the beginning to define the criteria of " success . "
Many people believe that the socialists get involved in privatisation or attack social protection unless it is absolutely necessity .
In Central Europe , the fundamental problem of the right is its lack of a clearly defined identity .
The main political battles are taking place between the essentially antidemocratic nationalist and populist forces on one side , and the forces fighting for democracy on the other .
The threat of Meciar 's return to power led all the Democrats , from both right and left , to stand up together .
Even if every new shop steals some of the clientele of Wal-Mart stores in the vicinity , the effectiveness of supply steadily improving helps maintain the overall growth of the chain .
Love it or hate it , Wal-Mart is undeniably the perfect example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization .
And the arrival of these hypers in a community crushes long-established retailers , and often transforms the community 's personality is a startling way .
Yes , up to a certain point , it is the price to pay for progress .
The scientific revolution has been made possible by the press prints , the industrial revolution in the steam engine and if India from the famine , it is thanks to higher yields , the so-called " green revolution . "
The era of globalization that we live emerged with the spread of computers and Internet .
The mistakes of the wealthy countries would not be significant if the African countries had enough money to acquire the necessary technologies by themselves , but Africa is so poor that it needs financial assistance in order to escape from poverty .
The challenges of development in Africa are just one example of how difficult social problems can be solved thanks to the design and the spread of improved technologies .
After all , technological progress also requires good governance , market forces , effective universities and more .
Politics also has a role to play .
Why , then , the surprising lack of real growth in the past 25 years ?
I reject the responsibility on two unsolved but soluble problems .
These sectors are technologically sophisticated , but form a narrow base for long-term development .
The situation is far from hopeless .
These cities and others have seen house prices inflate since then . Prices have risen to at least 50 % in fixed prices since 2000 .
This was the source of major unexpected profits for owners , but also the source of a problem for anyone preparing to buy a property .
Moreover , terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone ; Indonesia , Spain and Russia have suffered their own tragedies .
We are reassured by investing in real estate , and there is little reason to expect an imminent change .
The prices in glamorous cities will fall significantly in the next recession or when the economy will suffer it 's next major impact or if interest rates rise too quickly .
Then the contagion within and across the markets will fall , making prices faill for years .
Of course , rich countries have some advantages : they enjoy generally temperate climates , where the rains are regular , and have usually little risk of drought or flood .
Even so , they are not immune to water-related disasters , as the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina has shown us .
Delegates of the World Water Forum will have multiple opportunities to build and strengthen these partnerships .
If successful , the benefits that poor people worldwide will draw will be immense .
The dismantling of the internal borders of the EU has all of a sudden extended the size of national markets and resulted in the planned economies of scale .
But this phenomenon has favoured small European countries more then large ones , and has meant more competition for Germany , the largest economy in Europe .
